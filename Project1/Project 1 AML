Normalization and Scaling
	Robust scaler
	normalizer -> gives low cv scores
	scaler

Outlier detecion
	Mean and median value very simmilar
	Max very different
	1)Isolation Forest
	    contamination
	2)Local outlier factor
	3)EllipticEnvelope -> low cv score (with standard parameters)

Imputation
	Data very big
	knn and fitting and estimator won't work - I guess
	1) Mean, median, mode, constant
	2)forward fill & backward fill (probably dont make sense because MRI data)

Feature selection
    Only for not tree based methods
	1)Variance methods
	2)Filter out similar features ->scitkit
	3)L1
	4)Tree based methods

Estimation
	XGBoost (tree)/ RandomForrest
	SVR
	Kernelized Ridge
