Normalization and Scaling
	Robust scaler
	normalizer
	scaler

Outlier detecion
	Mean and median calue very simmilar
	Max very different
	1)Fit Gaussian to coloumns, and filter out after certain std
	2)scitkit learn outlier detectors

Imputation
	Data very big
	knn and fitting and estimator won't work - I guess
	1) Mean, median, mode, constant
	2)forward fill & backward fill (probably dont make sense because MRI data)

Feature selection
	1)Variance methods
	2)Filter out similar features ->scitkit
	3)L1
	4)Tree based methods

Estimation
	Lasso
	Ridge
	XGboost (tree)
	Robust regression?
