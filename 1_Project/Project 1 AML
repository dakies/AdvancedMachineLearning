Normalization and Scaling
	Robust scaler
	normalizer
	scaler

Outlier detecion
	Mean and median calue very simmilar
	Max very different
	How is this treated in the
	1)Fit Gaussian to coloumns, and filter out after certain std
	scitkit
	2)Isolation Forest
	    contamination
	3)Local outlier factor

Imputation
	Data very big
	knn and fitting and estimator won't work - I guess
	1) Mean, median, mode, constant
	2)forward fill & backward fill (probably dont make sense because MRI data)

Feature selection
    Only for not tree based methods
	1)Variance methods
	2)Filter out similar features ->scitkit
	3)L1
	4)Tree based methods

Estimation
	Lasso
	Ridge
	XGboost (tree)
	SVR
	MLPRegressor - NeuralNet
	Robust regression? - Not feasable for large datasets
